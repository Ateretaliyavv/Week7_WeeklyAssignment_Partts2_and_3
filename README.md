# 3D Exercise Week 7​

In this project, we implemented a 3D action game in which the player controls a character moving in a three-dimensional environment while facing intelligent enemies.

## Section B - 2
I added advanced player movement abilities in a 3D world:

Movement and running using the arrow keys.

Jumping using the Space key.

Crawling using the C key together with the arrow keys for movement.

The movement system allows smooth control and natural combination of actions during gameplay.

## Section C - 3
I implemented an enemy with dynamic behavior:

The enemy chases the player in the 3D environment.

The enemy shoots only at close range, forcing the player to keep distance and move strategically.

When the enemy hits the player, the player loses health, and the game detects when the player is defeated.

Game Objective
Progress through the 3D environment, avoid enemies, and use movement abilities (running, jumping, and crawling) strategically in order to survive.
